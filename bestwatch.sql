(2, 2, 4, 'There''s a real allure to costume-dramas that pair dense mythology with all of the crowd-pleasing elements of war, honor, pride, lust, power and, yes, even humor. Thrones has all of those in spades and supports them with exceptional storytelling, strong writing, superb acting and some stunning visual effects.'),
(3, 3, 4, 'Stick with it. Free your eyes to take in the spectacle, and your brain will magically start following the intricate storytelling. And there''s a magical realism to Game of Thrones.'),
(4, 5, 1, 'Vikings enthrallingly captures the world of Norsemen and oarsmen, circa 793 in the Eastern Baltic but soon heading West to England.'),
(5, 1, 1, 'While they are every bit as wild and woolly as the historical figures of Norse sagas, such is the power of Vikings that we come to know and even root for them, so enthralling are they and almost everything else here.'),
(6, 2, 1, 'History''s first scripted series is a headlong tumble into an irresistible and surprisingly neglected genre.'),
(7, 1, 2, 'Solid start to what could--and maybe should--be a future CW franchise.'),
(8, 2, 2, 'Your interest in Arrow depends on how much you miss the troubled-in-love, conflicted-by-family heroics of Smallville--it mirrors that series'' setup.'),
(9, 3, 2, 'The pilot of Arrow is a darkly gleaming gem. If the show can keep up its cinema-quality action sequences and maintain an air of mystery to Ollie''s agenda, this could be a really fun series.'),
(10, 1, 3, 'Slowly, a smartly constructed epic is taking shape.'),
(11, 2, 3, 'It is, flat out, one of the most intriguingly entertaining new series of the year, and it’s so much more than pure entertainment. For a sci-fi series, there’s some real heft to it.'),
(12, 3, 3, '[A] gritty, visceral, and emotionally engaging thriller.'),
(13, 5, 5, 'Lost is a sci-fi soap opera adventure -- with humor, mystery and interesting characters galore...It''s "Survivor" with the one thing "Survivor" lacks -- a terrific script.'),
(14, 3, 5, 'An intense, intriguing and exciting mix of action and horror. '),
(15, 2, 5, 'It''s safe to say you''ve not seen anything like it on network television. And not to put too fine a point on it, but the shock does wear off after a few minutes.'),
(16, 1, 6, 'We see promise in Tom Riley''s Leonardo da Vinci'),
(17, 2, 6, 'No one should base a term paper on it, but Da Vinci''s Demons is at least an entertaining lie.'),
(18, 3, 6, 'Da Vinci''s Deamons is exactly what i was expecting from David S. Goyer. It is one of the best seasons i have see. Cast is superb and they have shown the reality of that time''s Pope. I like it very much.'),
(19, 1, 8, 'A hilarious holiday package.'),
(20, 2, 8, 'The Simpsons" is both a challenge and a delight. It''s also that rarest of TV fauna, a cartoon show with levels of mirth for every brain and pair of eyes in the family.'),
(21, 3, 9, 'At its best, Friends operates like a first-rate Broadway farce, complete with slamming doors, twisty plots, and intricately strung together jokes. And even when it''s not at its best, the crack acting and piquant punchlines give Friends a momentum and charm that win you over even if you''re not laughing.'),
(22, 5, 9, 'The best new sitcom of the fall...It''s a very strong cast.'),
(23, 1, 9, 'Very Funny :D'),
(24, 1, 13, 'This show will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat like no other. Especially every time it gets toward the end of a season, good lord. It really is the best show I''ve seen in years personally.'),
(25, 2, 13, 'Breaking Bad is a bit of a load, more weighted than wacky, and surprisingly predictable for a show whose main character is first discovered wearing a gas mask but no trousers.'),
(26, 3, 13, 'The acting is as good as you''ll see on TV (take a hard look at the genius of RJ Mitte, who really does have CP). And the script and plot are as out-there as creator/writer/producer Vince Gilligan''s other series, "The X-Files."'),
(27, 2, 14, 'The series'' grim tone and overall look of a grimy world in perpetual need of dusting or wiping is a long way from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and closer to Japanese movies like The Grudge.'),
(28, 3, 14, 'Padalecki and Ackles are hunky, funny and a joy to watch.'),
(29, 5, 14, 'It is a well-made little show of horrors that''s likely to scare and thrill its target audience.'),
(30, 1, 21, 'Tremendously clever fun, Masterpiece Mystery! presents the first of three modernizations of the Sherlock Holmes tales.'),
(31, 2, 21, 'The result is a sharp, funny, clever series that remains faithful to the spirit of Doyle''s stories while infusing them with a vibrant spirit of modernity.'),
(32, 3, 21, 'The appeal is elementary: good, unpretentious fun, something that''s in short supply around here.'),
(33, 5, 21, 'Sherlock is evidence that the BBC is the last remaining beacon of hope in a sea of mass-produced money driven TV shows which are nothing but the same old crap reskinned again and again. With each episode roughly the length of a film, Sherlock is an excellent take on some old stories, and with stellar acting to boot. Easily the best show currently on TV.'),
(34, 2, 19, 'Fantastic, fascinating, creepy, charming and gruesome.'),
(35, 1, 19, 'If you want edge, here''s Dexter. '),
(36, 3, 19, 'Sick, twisted and darkly funny, "Dexter" is easily the best drama in Showtime history.'),
(37, 2, 15, 'These killers are more fun than a cemetery full of psycho zombie killers on Halloween.'),
(38, 3, 15, 'There’s an engrossing moodiness to Mr. Williamson’s latest venture, but one he conveys without annulling the pact he long ago made with himself never to let his cheekiness go undetected.'),
(39, 1, 15, 'No, it''s not Twilight--but it''s not bad, either. The Vampire Diaries, The CW''s new fang-gang drama, successfully hitches the sanguinary sexuality of the vampire ethos to the in-group/out-group dynamic of the teen soap.'),
(40, 5, 2, 'Slow in the beginning but builds momentum with time.'),
(41, 1, 5, 'The plot is really wonderful.'),
(42, 5, 11, 'Cosmos unveiled the inner secrets of life and God'),
(43, 5, 11, 'Cosmos is one of the best documentaries ever created'),
